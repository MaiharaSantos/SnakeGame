# SnakeGame
I want to improve my programming skills, so I decided to make some small projects to review things I know and to learn things I don't know .
For this first project, I will create a Snake Game (the classic version) by myself. It is a game that I really enjoyed as a child, and I think that it will be a enjoyable experience.
For this project, I will use just C and the SDL2.0 library (https://www.libsdl.org/).
